## Automation refers to tasks, whereas orchestration is the automation of linked tasks.

### Automation
Despite how we might refer to automation in a day-to-day context, in the context of IT, automation generally refers to a system that can complete a single repetitive task without human intervention. These can be any thousands of single tasks, such as:

1. Sending IT alerts
1. Launching web servers 
1. Routing emails
1. Automation tools are often applied to simple “if this, then that'' processes
1. While what you automate is very likely part of a larger process, you’re often only automating small pieces at a time.

## orchestration
#### The goal of orchestration is to streamline and optimize frequent, repeatable processes. Companies know that the shorter the time-to-market, the more likely they’ll achieve success. Anytime a process is repeatable, and its tasks can be automated, orchestration can be used to optimize the process in order to eliminate redundancies.

> For tech-enabled companies (which is practically everyone), the main use cases for orchestration include:

Speedier software development
Batch processing daily transactions
Managing many servers and applications
Data analytics

### Automation and orchestration benefits :
Automating one task may impress your users or make them aware that something has sped up a little bit. On its own, simple automations will not make a big perceivable difference. But when automation is built into a series of processes and workflows, which are then orchestrated to run automatically, there can be endless benefits.
